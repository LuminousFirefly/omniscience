"Omniscience" is a custom server that is driven by OpenAI's ChatGPT & Dall.E API. It uses Express/Node.JS for server-side programming, and Axios to handle client-server communication. 

"Ominscience" offers an efficient and easy-to-use interface wherein users can: 
-> Input any text/prompt of their choice.
-> Based on the user input, they can choose to receive a chatbot response (text response) or generate an image relating to the prompt (image response).
-> The text/image is rendered on the screen, and the user has to simply click on the rendered output to download the result to their computer! The output can be downloaded as a .txt file for text responses, and a .jpg file for image responses. 

"Omniscience", still being in the development stage, does have certain limitations as of now:
-> The server is only locally hosted, but there are plans to deploy the server remotely in the coming future. 
-> "Omniscience" doesn't possess the ability to store previous responses or queries, and thus is suitable for a one-off query rather than fully-fledged convesations.  
-> Error codes and messages aren't sent back, and hence the page merely crashes in the event of an error.
